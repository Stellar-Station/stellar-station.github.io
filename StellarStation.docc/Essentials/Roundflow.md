# Roundflow

Understand the desired path of players through a round

## Start-Of-Round

Crew players start the shift congregated in a single place, to encourage them to mingle outside of the bounds of their departments.

## Mid-Round

Different factions on the station have different goals to work towards.
Crew might find themselves working on a research project, while the Cosmic Cult seeks to usher in the end.

These goals provide something for players of all factions to proactively work towards during a round.

Different factions will also need to react to disruptions caused by eachother and the world at large.

## End-Of-Round

The round will end once one of the factions has completed their goals.
A crew completion will lead to the station bluespace jumping somewhere else, while a Cosmic Cult beckoning causes the station to be consumed by The End.

The round will also end at 1 hour and 30 minutes should none of the factions complete their goals by then.
This is framed through a local phenomenon that requires the crew to escape.

The phenomenon has a ramping-up period as the 1h30m mark draws near.
This warns the factions on the station that they are running out of time and something is about to go wrong.

Once the 1h30m mark is passed, the station will begin escape procedures to get out of the situation.

## Escaping

If something goes wrong during a round that the crew needs to get out of, they can initiate an escape sequence.

Different escape sequences have different conditions for the crew to get out alive.

For example, scuttling the station and launching evacuation pods will require crew to be able to successfully get onto small pods before the station is scuttled.
Initiating a station-wide bluespace jump will require the crew to defend their bluespace drive until the station can safely jump out of the situation.
